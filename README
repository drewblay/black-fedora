# Overview of Black Fedora
This goal of Black Fedora is to automate the installation of pentesting tools on Fedora Linux. 
Ultimately I want a quick and easy way for people to have all the tools included in Kali Linux installed on their Fedora boxes.

## Installation
Make sure the scripts are executable (chmod +x).
Run master_install.sh to install everything in the Tools folder.
Alternativley edit master_install.sh to comment out anything you might not want, or just run indival installtion scripts from the Tools folder if only want a few of them.
